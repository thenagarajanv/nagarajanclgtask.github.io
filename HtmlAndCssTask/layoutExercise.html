    <h2>Supervised ML</h2>
    <p>
        As its name suggests, Supervised machine learning is based on supervision. It means in the supervised 
        learning technique, we train the machines using the "labelled" dataset, and based on the training, the
        machine predicts the output. Here, the labelled data specifies that some of the inputs are already mapped
        to the output. More preciously, we can say; first, we train the machine with the input and corresponding 
        output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.

  <div id="second" class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>UnSupervised ML</h2>
    <p>Unsupervised learning is different from the Supervised learning technique; as its name suggests,
       there is no need for supervision. It means, in unsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained 
       using the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts the output without any supervision.
    </p>

  <div id="third" class="column" style="background-color:#ccc;">
    <h2>Semi-Supervised ML</h2>
    <p>Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that lies between Supervised and 
        Unsupervised machine learning. It represents the intermediate ground between Supervised 
        (With Labelled training data) and Unsupervised learning (with no labelled training data) 
        algorithms and uses the combination of labelled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.
